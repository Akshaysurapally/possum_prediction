# Possum Head Length Prediction

In this project, I was to predict the Head Length of a possum based on certain features.

I used LinearRegression, Lasso, Ridge, RandomForestRegressor and XGBRegressor

If you go through the notebook(prediction.ipynb), you will see how I implemented the process of selecting the best model, the best features and testing the model on a new sample data.

I then built a flask API and loaded the saved model and tested it via PostMan

Feel free to contribute to this project...maybe build a frontend for it that can consume the flask API endpoints
